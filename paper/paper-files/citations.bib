abstract = {Yolk formation in the Monarch butterfly, as in many other insects, entails juvenile hormone-induced synthesis in the fat body, transport in the hemolymph, and uptake into the oocytes of specific sex-limited protein, the vitellogenin. In the Monarch, vitellogenin first appears in the hemolymph 1 day after emergence of the adult butterfly and then rises rapidly in concentration for at least 3 days. The synthesis of vitellogenin in adult females was shown by the incorporation of [3H]leucine. Active labeling was observed at the same time as the presence of vitellogenin in the hemolymph was first detectable, and the radioactivity in vitellogenin expressed as a percentage of radioactivity in total blood proteins reached 50â€“60% 3 days after adult emergence. The appearance of vitellogenin was prevented by ligature of freshly emerged butterflies at the neck and restored by injection of juvenile hormone. A low yet significant stimulation of vitellogenin synthesis could be detected as early as 10 hr after administration of the hormone into neck-ligated butterflies, and after 30 to 50 hr about 40% of the total blood protein label was found in the specific protein. With C18-juvenile hormone (JH-I), 0.1 $\mu$g per animal was effective in inducing a low level of vitellogenin synthesis, and between 0.01 and 1 $\mu$g, a linear relationship between synthesis and log dose was observed. The synthetic analog ZR-512 was also active. In a preliminary experiment, actinomycin D effectively blocked the induction of vitellogenin synthesis.},

abstract = {Monarch butterflies are best known from their migratory North American range, although many resident, year-round breeding populations are established throughout the world. Here, we evaluate two non-exclusive hypotheses for the loss of migration in resident monarch populations: (1) absence of cues that trigger migration; and (2) loss of sensory, neural or physiological systems required for migration. To evaluate the first hypothesis, we exposed resident monarchs from Queensland, Australia to decreasing larval photoperiod and observed reproductive development in resulting females to assess their propensity to show reduced reproductive development, a precursor for long-distance migration. To address the second hypothesis, we measured antennal circadian clock gene expression, a crucial element of the monarch's ability to orientate directionally, in a resident and a migratory population. We found that Australian resident monarchs show reduced reproductive development in response to decreasing photoperiod, consistent with the 'loss of cues' hypothesis. We found no differences in antennal clock gene expression between migratory and resident populations, inconsistent with the 'loss of mechanism' hypothesis. Together, these data indicate that even after hundreds of generations of non-migration, monarchs retain two crucial elements of their migratory repertoire: developmental plasticity associated with decreasing photoperiod and antennal circadian rhythms necessary for directional orientation.},
annote = {This paper is what specifically lead to my Monarch project in collaboration with Micah. Principally, they found that some proportion of non-migratory QLD monarch butterflies still respond to migratory cues (declining day-length) by entering reproductive diapause. Critically, they also found that the probability that an individual would enter diapause depends on the family from which that individual came, indicating either a heritable or maternal effect. They also found that non-migratory monarchs still express clock genes at different levels at different times. This leads directly into my question: if QLD monarchs have heritable migratory response as this paper suggests, are the genes responsible the same as in NA butterflies. If so, how did they persist across multiple population bottlenecks? If not, which genes control migration and how recently did they evolve?},
